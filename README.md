Pocket Storage! Not complete yet.

The idea is that a host machine (ideally a Raspberry pi properly setup with a storage device and internet connection) runs the app, and tunneling can be turned on or off via Ngrok to provide access from the outside world.

Intended for personal use! I recommend setting security up on the removable storage device.
